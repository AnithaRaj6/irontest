# OldPhoneKeypadEmulator
The Old Phone Keypad Emulator is a Windows Forms application that simulates an old mobile phone keypad for text input. The emulator interprets input sequences and converts them into text as per the rules of multi-tap input on old phones. This project was developed as part of a coding challenge.
